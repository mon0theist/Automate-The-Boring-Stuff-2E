# Automate-The-Boring-Stuff-2E
My solutions to the newly released 2nd Edition of Al Sweigart's "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python" book.

Unless otherwise noted, all solutions are done using only what's been taught in the book up to that point. Other solutions on GitHub use techniques that weren't taught in the book, which completely defeats the point in my opinion.

Differences between the 1st Edition and 2nd Edition:
